1. First learn how to formailly and completely state the hypothesis.
2. Explore the releationship between "Prime number theorem" of Gauss and the Reimann Hypothesis.
3. Reimann is not a number theorist but his hypothesis is still un-proven and most important unproven conjecture in number theory and whole of mathematics.
4. Attributed to Hilbert: If a slept for a thousand years and awake, the first question I asked would be "Did Reimann hypothesis proved"?
